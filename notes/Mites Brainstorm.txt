Mites Brainstorm

- Little robots that mine contiguous blocks
- Cheap-ish to make, but consumed upon use
- Advanced version that is not consumed and is tweakable
- 1/2 robotic, 1/2 organic

World mites
Wood Mite => Use on a block of 8 chests to get Mitey Chest
        Mitey Chest => Double size chest in single block
                            => Used for mite storage with bonuses
                                 (no stack limit for mites?)
Leaf Mite => Mulch/Ferment => Power source => Alcohol?
        Alcohol => Power
                     => Can be drunk => Speed II
                                                 => Drink too much = blindness?
                     => Alcosac? (doesn't need external containers)
Ore Mite => Better ores take longer?
               => Better versions have smelting/doubling mechanic?
               => Enchant stack to get smelting/doubling or ability to
                    work on better ores
Thirsty Mite => Removes contiguous water (max radius/blockcount)
Torch Mite => Infests blocks, causes them to emit light
{
Tunnel Mite => Digs 2x1 tunnel in front of you
Borehole Mite => Bores 1x1 tunnel down
Stairwell Mite => Digs out a stairwell creation
} - Put into Advanced Mite?

Player mites
Crafty Mite => Used to craft other mites autonomously, just
                        consuming inventory materials
                   => Set recipe and it uses inventory material
                   => Expand to autonomously craft other materials
                        (take up 4 inventory slots?)
Ender Mite => Keeps inventory restocked from EnderMound?
                                                                           Colony?
                   => Option to remove empties? (RF Capacitors etc)
Greedy Mite => Consumption of inventory items
                     => Upon 'effect' removal (potion when effect wears off,
                          food when hunger drops to enough space)
Decaying Mite => Turns player invisible to mobs
                        => Zombifies player skin (pigman => zombie pig)
                        => Takes up 1 inventory slot and consumes rotten
                             flesh
                        => Player burns in sunlight
                        => Gives player hunger V?
                        => Eating Thaumcraft zombie brain temporarily
                             stops hunger 

Colony => Grows vs constructed? Worldgen?
            => Need to be located near a food source?

Mitey Queen => Rideable
                      => Feeding ? produces Slurmite?
                      => Slurmite tools?

Mechanics => Mites not crafted but found?
                  => Occasional drop from task?
                          => Leaf Mites like silkworms
                          => Wood from logs
                          => Ore from ore
                  => New mites crafted by placing existing mite and
                       consumable resource?
                  => Mitey Grid => Mark area from colony that mites will
                                              operate over
                  => Player mites eaten and then take up a certain
                       number of inventory slots (crafty = 4, ender = 2,
                       greedy = 1 (hotbar?), etc)
