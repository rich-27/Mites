Mites Brainstorm

- Little robots that mine contiguous blocks
- Cheap-ish to make, but consumed upon use
- Advanced version that is not consumed and is tweakable
- 1/2 robotic, 1/2 organic

World mites
Wood Mite => Use on a block of 8 chests to get Mitey Chest
        Mitey Chest => Double size chest in single block
                            => Used for mite storage with bonuses
                                 (no stack limit for mites?)
Leaf Mite => Mulch/Ferment => Power source => Alcohol?
        Alcohol => Power
                     => Can be drunk => Speed II
                                                 => Drink too much = blindness?
                     => Alcosac? (doesn't need external containers)
Ore Mite => Better ores take longer?
               => Better versions have smelting/doubling mechanic?
               => Enchant stack to get smelting/doubling or ability to
                    work on better ores
Thirsty Mite => Removes contiguous water (max radius/blockcount)
Torch Mite => Infests blocks, causes them to emit light
{
Tunnel Mite => Digs 2x1 tunnel in front of you
Borehole Mite => Bores 1x1 tunnel down
Stairwell Mite => Digs out a stairwell creation
} - Put into Advanced Mite?
Withering Mite => Made with nether stars, kills wither quickly

Player mites
Crafty Mite => Used to craft other mites autonomously, just
                        consuming inventory materials
                   => Set recipe and it uses inventory material
                   => Expand to autonomously craft other materials
                        (take up 4 inventory slots?)
Ender Mite => Keeps inventory restocked from EnderMound?
                                                                           Colony?
                   => Option to remove empties? (RF Capacitors etc)
Greedy Mite => Consumption of inventory items
                     => Upon 'effect' removal (potion when effect wears off,
                          food when hunger drops to enough space)
Decaying Mite => Turns player invisible to mobs
                        => Zombifies player skin (pigman => zombie pig)
                        => Takes up 1 inventory slot and consumes rotten
                             flesh
                        => Player burns in sunlight
                        => Gives player hunger V?
                        => Eating Thaumcraft zombie brain temporarily
                             stops hunger
Learned Mite => Thaumcraft integration
                        => Attempts to research anything the player is looking at fgor long enough
                        => Expensive
                        => Minimilistic screen rendering
Creepy Mite => Shows your trail (on button down? button to toggle?)

Colony => Grows vs constructed? Worldgen?
            => Need to be located near a food source?

Mitey Queen => Rideable
                      => Feeding ? produces Slurmite?
                      => Slurmite tools?

Mechanics => Mites not crafted but found?
                  => Occasional drop from task?
                          => Leaf Mites like silkworms
                          => Wood from logs
                          => Ore from ore
                  => New mites crafted by placing existing mite and
                       consumable resource?
                  => Mitey Grid => Mark area from colony that mites will
                                              operate over
                  => Player mites eaten and then take up a certain
                       number of inventory slots (crafty = 4, ender = 2,
                       greedy = 1 (hotbar?), etc)
                  => Mites slowly eat away at tools that have the same
                       harvest target (tightly control target+config disable),
                       reducing durability. Will remember the amount of
                       durability consumed and drop the relevant
                       associated crafting ingredient (hardmode config just
                       leaves stick/rod?)
                       Thanks to Cazzar and Sequituri for the idea

Colony found in world (writhing block - custom model). As soon a player touches it, the become infested with info mite - vision dims and text scrolls across screen.
Upon breaking block, player receives infomite and mighty larvae. Larvae have to be placed in incubation pool (heated liquid) that then writhes (like go'a'uld). Pool stores data (fluid tile entity), with after a certain period of time larvae maturing into stemites.
Stemites consume like a normal mite, but without dropping items. After 15+/-5 blocks consumption, they drop a mite of the type of item they'd been consuming (reverse damage bar? drop when contiguity expires?).
Mites can be placed into larval pools to develop larvae straight into mites of the associated type. Item filtered transfer nodes can auto extract mites.
Heat causes increase in breeding rate, but flame kills them. Furnace powered beneath the pool is a good early game heat source, factorization heating element, heated redstone/high temperature generators provide speedy reproduction.
Blood used as medium will provide far higher incubation rate.

World mites can be gotten as standard. Upgrades through tossing certain items into larvae pools (firecharges for smelting - wood => charcoal, ores to ingots).
Player mites second tier.
Advanced mite 1/2 robotic, more flexible.
